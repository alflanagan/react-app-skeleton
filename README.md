# react-app-skeleton

Create-react-app is great for, well, creating an app. But I discovered two important things.

1. I will always want to customize the app in ways that require running `npm run eject`.

2. The result of ejecting is an enormous complex mess, with a whole lot of things I don't need (and you most likely don't either), very outdated dependencies, and a lot of interlocked dependencies.

As an alternative, I'm building this repository with the dependencies I need, simple configuration and setup, and an overall great developer experience.
